### What Happens Next:

1. **Auto-Deploy**: Vercel will automatically detect the push to GitHub and deploy
2. **Wait Time**: Usually takes 1-2 minutes
3. **Live Site**: Changes will be live at www.botnology101.com

### Verify Deployment:

Once deployed, test these features:

1. Visit www.botnology101.com
2. Click "Yeti Mode" - should toggle theme
3. Refresh page - theme should persist
4. Click "Sign In" - modal should open
5. Sign in with your email
6. Go to /pricing.html
7. Click any "Monthly" or "Annual" button
8. Should redirect to Lemon Squeezy checkout

### Lemon Squeezy Configuration:

Your Lemon Squeezy integration is configured with these Variant IDs:

- Associates Monthly: `price_1Sq35RK6UhzkJnxUOJOqVUxU`
- Associates Annual: `price_1Sq35RK6UhzkJnxUDrjqCFmD`
- Bachelors Monthly: `price_1Sq38sK6UhzkJnxUOajgkvKV`
- Bachelors Annual: `price_1Sq3BGK6UhzkJnxUEUOZwOgc`
- Masters Monthly: `price_1Sq3FhK6UhzkJnxUFZEYdlQD`
- Masters Annual: `price_1Sq3HwK6UhzkJnxUGZ0Gr02O`

These are set as fallbacks in the code, so checkout will work even without environment variables.

### Environment Variables Needed in Vercel:

Make sure these are set in Vercel Dashboard > Settings > Environment Variables:

```bash
LEMON_SQUEEZY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
APP_SECRET=your-random-secret
```

Generate APP_SECRET:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Debugging:

If something doesn't work after deployment:

1. **Check Vercel Logs**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard
   - Click on your deployment
   - View "Functions" tab

2. **Check Browser Console** (F12):
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check Network tab for failed API calls

3. **Test Health Endpoint**:
   ```
   https://www.botnology101.com/api/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status":"ok","openai":true,"lemonsqueezy":true}`
